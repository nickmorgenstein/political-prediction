# political prediction
Project Proposal for CS 152

I am interested in using a neural net to predict whether a voter will vote for a political candidate. Since voting outcomes by person is not an available data set, I will use a proxy widely considered to be accurate in the political world: canvassing. It turns out that voters will be realitvely accurate about who they will vote for based on whether they say they will vote for someone at the door. 

I worked on a San Francisco political campaign in 2020, so I have a dataset of about 14,000 people who were contacted by via canvassing, with about 15 pieces of demographic information per voter, and the outcome of whether they said they'd vote for the candidate. 

Applications: There are pretty cool applications for this project. Technology like ML have been slow to reach politics, especially at a local level (as in below congressional/presidential levels), yet much of American political change occurs at that level. Developing some neural net that can maximize this type of data could be used on all sorts of other campaigns. Side note: a lot of ethical discussions need to be had around this subject. Even without application, it'd be cool. 

# project goals
1. Clean and prepare a dataset
2. Make an accurate NN for prediction
3. Have fun...
4. Ethics considerations
